# Sending-emails-using-Python-smtplib
To send emails, I created this project using the Python smtplib package.

Before testing this project, I would recommend to create two new mail account and turn of the two step verification and other security steps because google or yahoo doesn't allow other thrid party app to access their mail database.

### For Gmail:
<ol> Enable two step verification from the mail settings. </ol>
<ol> Go to Security --> App password --> Login again --> From the dropdown menu, select app category and device and then click generate password. </ol>
<ol> Copy that password and paste it as the value of <b>my_pass</b> variable.</ol>
<ol> Use those two mail id you created into the code. One for sending(for which you generated password for) and one fore receiving. </ol>

### For Yahoo:
<ol> Enable two step verification from the mail settings. </ol>
<ol> Go to Account info --> Account security --> Generate and manage password --> Login again --> Write down the app name and then click generate password. </ol>
<ol> Copy that password and paste it as the value of <b>my_pass</b> variable.</ol>
